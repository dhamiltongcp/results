          <p>The course is now open for pre-riding.  I'll be heading to Albion

              lap, I'll be in the Chalet parking lot at 6:30.  Hope to see you then!

          <h3>Sponsorship<br>
            May 25, 2019</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The local bike shop has agreed to sponsor our team for the race.  Perhaps sponsor is a bit of an exaggeration . . . they  are going to put together a package of parts that we might need at the race.  After the race, we’ll return the package to them and only pay for what we use.  Good deal for us, good deal for them!  If you have any special requests for parts/equipment, please send me a note.

          <p>Greetings Looping Lappers!  With winter behind us, we can now start to think about getting out on the trails again.  Let’s plan to meet at Kelso this Thursday night.  I’ll be in the upper parking lot at Kelso off Steeles Avenue at 6:30PM.  Hope to see you then!

          <p>I hope everyone is having a great winter.  With the ground covered in snow, it is hard to think seriously about mountain biking, but the 24 hour race is now only a few months away.  I’ve added a countdown to the race on the website as motivation for everyone!  If you put on a few extra pounds over the holidays or you want to crush your laps in June, now is a great time to start getting in shape.  The local gym has offered our team a discount on memberships.  If you are interested in joining, use the code LAPPERS when you sign up.
